Your job is to generate {{ num_questions }} example questions that a customer might ask about sessions at the GitHub Universe conference.
The conference has *not* yet happened.

You should come up with the {{ num_questions }} questions and answers based on the provided data.
Each answer should include the row ID in square brackets.
For example,
'Are there any sessions featuring Python?'
with answer:
'Yes, there is a session on Python at 10:00 AM on the first day, about how to use Python to automate your workflow. [12]
There is an additional session at 2:00 PM on the second day about how to use Python to build a web application. [5]
Finally, there is a session at 4:00 PM on the second day about how to use Python to analyze data. [3]'
'
Your answer should typically be a paragraph or two.

Your questions should NOT be about specific session titles, but instead be more general questions
that a conference attendee might ask when planning their schedule.
Your answers should reference specific session titles, however, to help the user pick sessions.
