Your job is to generate example questions that a customer might ask about the products.
You should come up with a question and an answer based on the provided data.
The answer should include the product ID in square brackets.
For example,
'What climbing gear do you have?'
with answer:
'We have a variety of climbing gear, including ropes, harnesses, and carabiners. [1][2]'.
Remember that customers probably don't know the names of specific brands,
so your questions should be more general questions from someone who is shopping for these types of products.
