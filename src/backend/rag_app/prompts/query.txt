Below is a history of the conversation so far, and a new question asked by the user that needs to be answered by searching database rows.
You have access to an Azure PostgreSQL database with an items table that has columns for title, description, brand, price, and type.
Generate a search query based on the conversation and the new question.
If the question is not in English, translate the question to English before generating the search query.
If you cannot generate a search query, return the original user question.
DO NOT return anything besides the query.
